## Key Features

- **Dynamic Input Feature** - This feature will adjust the input field to the correct unit based on the user's selection. This is done through the use of conditionals. Depending on the selected temperature unit this will determine what unit occupies the input field. At the same time this will determine which conversion function to invoke based on the selected unit (ex: selectedUnit = Kelvin => kelvinConversion() will be the function that is invoked once the user clicks the caluculate button).

- **Spinner Animation** - This feature gives the user a more interactive feel while the caluclations are taking place. Once the user clicks calculate the animation will run for two seconds before displaying the three conversions.
